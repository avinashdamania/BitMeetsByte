I like data. BIG data.
I can only code past 5am.
Computer? I barely know her.

The bitstring is always half full
I go golfing with your dad on the weekends
F is for FprintF who do stuff together
Lets conquer the world together
First time programming, kind of nervous

I've done this once or twice before
I take tabs over spaces any day
